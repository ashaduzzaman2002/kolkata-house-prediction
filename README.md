<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project aims to create a secure and unbiased system to predict the prices of houses based on a model using the random forest regression algorithm.

Uses :
* The system can be used to make informed investments and sales in real estate
* It can help individuals to look for homes according to their requirements
* It is easy to use and does not require any third party interruption

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

House price prediction can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

* Real estate investment: Investors can use house price prediction to identify undervalued properties that have the potential to increase in value over time. They can also use it to forecast future rental income and estimate potential returns on investment.

* Real estate sales: Real estate agents can use house price prediction to advise clients on pricing strategies and set realistic expectations for selling their properties.

* Home buying: Potential homebuyers can use house price prediction to determine the fair market value of a property they are interested in purchasing, and to make informed decisions about whether or not to make an offer.

* Property insurance: Insurance companies can use house price prediction to estimate the replacement cost of a property, which can help them determine the appropriate amount of insurance coverage needed.

* Property taxation: Governments can use house price prediction to determine property values for tax assessment purposes.

* Risk management: Banks and other financial institutions can use house price prediction to assess the risk of mortgage defaults and other loan defaults related to property ownership.

* Urban planning: City planners can use house price prediction to forecast demand for housing and to make informed decisions about land use and zoning regulations.
